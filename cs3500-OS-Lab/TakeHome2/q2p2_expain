Valgrind Analysis for Scenario 1:

When we run this program using Valgrind, it will detect the memory error and report it as an invalid write

Valgrind correctly identifies the invalid write and provides information about where it occurred in our code.

In the second scenario, we allocate memory for an array of 100 integers, free that memory using free(data), and then attempt to print the value of data[0]. Accessing memory that has been freed results in undefined behavior, and the program may crash or produce unpredictable results.

In the second scenario, we allocate memory for an array of 100 integers, free that memory using free(data), and then attempt to print the value of data[0]. Accessing memory that has been freed results in undefined behavior, and the program may crash or produce unpredictable results.
When we run this program using Valgrind, it will detect the use of freed memory and report it as an invalid read

Valgrind correctly identifies the invalid read from freed memory and provides information about where it occurred in our code.

In both scenarios, the programs are incorrect due to undefined behavior resulting from memory access violations. Valgrind is a valuable tool for detecting and debugging memory-related issues like these by providing detailed reports of memory errors. It helps us identify and fix problems that can lead to crashes and unexpected behavior in our programs.
